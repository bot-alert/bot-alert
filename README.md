# Hi, I’m Ashish Khatiwada 👋

I’m a Software Engineer from Nepal who enjoys building practical, reliable, and scalable software.

## 🌐 What I Do

### **Backend Development**
I primarily work with **Java (Spring Boot & Hibernate)** to build stable and scalable backend systems.  
I enjoy working on:
- REST API design
- Authentication & authorization (JWT)
- Database modeling
- Microservice-style architectures
- High-performance services using **Go** and **Rust**

### **Frontend Development**
I build responsive and user-friendly interfaces using:
- Angular
- React
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

I focus on clean UI structure, reusable components, and smooth API integration.

### **Mobile Development**
I develop cross-platform mobile apps using **Flutter (Dart)**.  
I enjoy building real-time features, clean UI flows, and app–backend interaction.
